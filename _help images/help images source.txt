These are the Paint.NET source files to the help images. It is not necessary to
translate these, but you can if you want to. Also, I have had some trouble 
getting Opera to localize files in subfolders, so I may not be able to get your
translated images to show up.

popup.png and trash.png are unedited screenshots. I did not edit them in 
Paint.NET, so there aren't any Paint.NET source files for those images.
