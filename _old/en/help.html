			<h1>New to Tab Vault?</h1>
			<p>
				If you aren't sure what Tab Vault is or how to use it, just read on.
				If you're the type that only reads the manual as a last resort, these
				links might interest you:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="options.html">Change your preferences</a></li>
				<li><a href="#" id="close">Get back to browsing!</a></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		
		<h2 class="expander">What is Tab Vault?</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				Tab Vault is a place to store the tabs you want to get to later 
				without leaving them loaded in memory and on your tab bar.
				
				Just like with Opera's tab bar, you can reorder and group tabs and
				restore deleted tabs from Tab Vault's trash list.
				
				Tab Vault also shows you the number of tabs you have stored to 
				remind you to get back to them.
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2 class="expander collapsed">How do I use Tab Vault?</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				Click the extension button to open Tab Vault. Tab Vault shows the
				number of tabs it has on this button. This (and many other things)
				can be changed from the 
				<a href="options.html" target="_blank">options page</a>.
			</p>

			<h3>The Tab Vault Interface</h3>
			<p>
				Tab Vault has two lists: Tabs and Trash. Tabs holds your saved tabs.
				Trash keeps deleted tabs in case you want to restore them. Click the
				<code>Tabs</code> and <code>Trash</code> links at the top of the 
				popup to change between the lists. 
				(The trash list is disabled if it is empty)
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="help/popup.png">
				<figcaption>The Tab Vault popup</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<h3>The Tabs List <span class="sub">Managing and Opening Tabs</span></h3>
			<p>
				Click <code>Save Tab</code> to save the current tab. Click and drag
				tabs to reorder them. Click a tab's <code>X</code> button to delete it. 
				You can also delete a tab by dragging it to <code>Trash</code> at the top.
				The tabs list only shows tab titles, but you can see a tab's URL by
				hovering your mouse over the tab.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are three ways to open a tab. Simply click a tab to open it
				in a new page. Hold <code>Ctrl</code> while clicking a tab to open 
				it in a background page. 
				Drag a tab from the popup and drop it on the web page to open it in 
				the current page.
			</p>
			
			<h3>The Trash List <span class="sub">Restoring Deleted Tabs</span></h3>
			<p>
				When you delete a tab, it goes here. Click on a trashed tab to
				restore it to the tabs list. Click <code>Clear List of Closed Tabs</code> 
				to permanently delete all the trashed tabs. 
				You cannot reorder trashed tabs.
			</p>

			<h3>Tab Groups</h3>
			<p>
				Tab Vault now supports tab groups. Groups have an expander arrow
				in place of a favicon and they don't have a <code>X</code> button.
				
				To create a group, start dragging a tab and move your cursor over the 
				arrow on the right of the tab. Now, drag the tab 
				over another tab so that the other tab darkens. Finally, drop the tab 
				to group the two tabs together. 
				
				<em>Note that the cursor must be over the right side of the tab to 
				activate grouping. This grouping area is boxed in red below.</em>
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="help/grouping.png">
				<figcaption>Grouping two tabs (Grouping area boxed in red)</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Click on the title of a tab group to expand or collapse it. To edit
				a group's name, click the pen icon to the right of the title. 
				Tab groups can be dragged and moved just like tabs, and you can drag 
				tabs in and out of expanded groups.
				
				A group will disappear when the last tab in the group is deleted or 
				moved outside the group. You can also delete an entire group by 
				dragging it to <code>Trash</code> at the top.
			</p>

				<img src="help/groups.png">
				<figcaption>Left: an expanded tab group. Right: editing a group's name</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Tab Vault's tab group implementation is designed to be very similar
				to Opera's tab stacking. Dropping a group onto a tab will merge the
				group into a new group under the tab. Dropping a group onto another
				collapsed group will merge the first into the second. Dropping a tab
				onto a collapsed group will add the tab to the group.
			</p>

		<div>
			<h3>Sessions</h3>
			<p>
				Tab Vault can import and export Opera session files from the
				Import/Export section of the 
				<a href="options.html" target="_blank">options page</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				To export your vault's tabs as a session file, click "Export Session". 
				Opera will open a new tab. Use <code>Menu > Page > Save As...</code> 
				(or Ctrl+S) to save this tab as a .win file.
			</p>
			<p>
				To import a session file, first open the .win file in a text editor 
				and copy everything from the file into the text box on the options page, 
				then click "Import Session". 
			</p>
			<p>
				You can find where Opera keeps your session files by going to
				<a href="opera:about">opera:about</a> and reading
				next to "Saved session". If you want your exported sessions to appear
				in Opera's session list, save them to this location.
			</p>
			<p>
				While I have designed Tab Vault so that it is very difficult for any 
				bug to cause catastrophic data loss, I have gotten (very rare) reports of 
				people's tabs completely disappearing from Tab Vault. 
				This could be because Opera lost Tab Vault's data after a crash, a 
				bug in Tab Vault I haven't discovered, or something else entirely.
				In any case, I recommend you periodically export your tabs for 
				safekeeping, just in case something does go wrong.
